# alpm

A lib for managing packages in arch linux.

This fork compiles on stable rust: [https://crates.io/crates/libalpm-fork](https://crates.io/crates/libalpm-fork)

The code is taken from here: https://github.com/jameslzhu/alpm  and published.
Unfortunately, the real author of the code didn't publish it.

Hopefully it'll be resolved over time and "jameslzhu" will publishe their code themselves.
